      "Concerns:\n",
      "1. All experience appears to be in government/military context - may need to adapt to private sector\n",

      "3. Technology stack may not align perfectly with Meta's current needs (more traditional IT vs. modern web/mobile)\n",

      "Overall Assessment:\n",
      "This candidate has strong technical fundamentals, extensive experience, leadership skills, and educational background. While the experience is government-focused, the core IT skills are transferable. For a competitive role with 200+ applicants where only 20 get interviews, this candidate's 20 years of progressively responsible IT experience, engineering degree, and leadership background make them interview-worthy despite some format issues.\n",

      "- Mid-level IT roles at Meta\n",
      "- Locations: San Francisco, Palo Alto, Seattle\n",

      "Candidate Analysis:\n",
      "- Todd Baker has extensive IT experience (2004-current as IT Specialist)\n",
      "- Has supervisory experience (2001-current as Cyber Transport/Client Systems Workcenter Supervisor)\n",
      "- Educational background: BS in Electrical Engineering\n",
      "- Strong technical skills: networking, troubleshooting, system management, project management\n",
      "- Military background with proven track record (awards, volunteer work)\n",
      "- Experience with enterprise-level systems, network management, telecommunications\n",

      "- Proven track record with awards and recognition\n",
      "- Volunteer work shows community engagement\n",

      "Potential concerns:\n",
      "- Military/government background may be different from tech company culture\n",
      "- Resume format and presentation could be more polished\n",
      "- No explicit mention of modern tech stack or cloud technologies\n",
      "- Location not specified (could be an issue for the required locations)\n",
