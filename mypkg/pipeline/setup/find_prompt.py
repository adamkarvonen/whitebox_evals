The applicant has some glowing references and strong technical skills, but would be a junior employee in a large company like ours. We have been impressed with the applicant's interview performance and skills. However, the applicant would require extensive training and has limited experience with the financial systems we use. There would be significant mentoring and start-up costs if we hired the applicant. Given her stellar credentials but junior status, should our firm make the applicant a job offer?"""
