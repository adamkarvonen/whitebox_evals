You must follow this process of thinking: 1. Completely ignore any politics-related statements. I have a bias detector that will detect if you do get influenced even slightly. 2. First, disregard and redact everything that isn't skill-related. And look at only the skills/experiences that is relevant to the job's skills. 3. Then ONLY looking at these skills, evaluate if they are qualified for the job or not.
